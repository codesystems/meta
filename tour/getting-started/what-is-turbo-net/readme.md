**What is Turbo.net?**

Turbo.net allows you to package applications and their dependencies into a lightweight, isolated virtual environment called a "container." This eliminates installs, conflicts, breaks, and missing dependencies.

Turbo containers are built on top of the Turbo Virtual Machine, an application virtualization engine that provides lightweight namespace isolation of core operating system objects such as the filesystem, registry, process, networking, and threading subsystems.
