**What is Turbo.net?**

Turbo.net streams thousands of applications to your desktop. No setups, ads or junkware. Applications can be auto-updated and backed up.

Turbo.net applications and their dependencies run in a lightweight, isolated virtual environment called a "container." This eliminates installs, conflicts, breaks, and missing dependencies.

Turbo containers are built on top of the Turbo Virtual Machine, an application virtualization engine that provides lightweight namespace isolation of core operating system objects such as the filesystem, registry, process, networking, and threading subsystems.

    # Hello Turbo.net World!
    
    # Each page will provide instructions for
    # using Turbo Containers.
