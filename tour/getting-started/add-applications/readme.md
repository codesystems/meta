**Add and Install Applications**

We have already added Firefox to our Dashboard. Now we will add some a few more applications before proceeding to install.

Navigate to the **Productivty** category.

Select any application(s) you would like. 

When completed click **Add**.

After the applications have been added click **Install**.

This will install the selected application(s) into your start menu under Turbo.net.
