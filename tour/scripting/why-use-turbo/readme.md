**Isolation**

Containers obviate the need for installers and prevent conflicts with natively installed software.


**Unprecedented Performance**

Turbo containers run at the same speed as applications running natively against the host hardware, with a minimal memory footprint.


**Dramatically reduced virtual environment size**

Turbo containers require a footprint proportional to the size of the virtualized application, data, and included components. As a result, Turbo containers are small enough to be quickly downloaded by end-users.


**User mode implementation**

The Turbo application virtualization engine is implemented entirely in user mode and does not require administrative privileges to run containerized applications.
